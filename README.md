# Summary
This a data analysis of Clinic no-show, the data source is https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments. it contains 110,527 medical appointments with 14 associated variables (characteristics) in Brazil.\
People can miss a medical appointment for multiple reasons.  Missing scheduled medical appointments will cause unnecessary waste of medical resources.Researchers found no-shows cost the U.S. health care system more than $150 billion a year and individual physicians an average of $200 per unused time slot. No-show is also detrimental to individual’s health. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the factors that cause people missing appointments in order to provide appropriate solutions to enhance the appointment arrival rate.\
Data processing was done with Python Pandas. this process including excluding missing data, using dummy variables to replace catigorical variables, generating new feature “days to appointment" to replace the schedule date and appointment date. In this dataset, the "show" to "no-show" ratio is 4:1, which will bring issue to modeling.  the undersampling method was applied to make the dataset balance.\
For modeling, several binary classification methods including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Logistic regression, support vector classifier, neural network were applied. \
